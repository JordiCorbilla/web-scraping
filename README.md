# Web scraping

Web scraping scripts to extract financial data. In a nutshell, this method can help you to get any information that it's available on any website using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library and python. The idea is to use this library to parse any DOM and get the data that we are interested in. Getting data from a list for example is a very simple job. Things get more interesting when we want to download more complex data like a table.
